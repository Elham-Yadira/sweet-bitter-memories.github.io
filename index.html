              <p class="af">You know what, YouTube is rubbing salt on my open wounds. They are suggesting me their so called spritual fact videos. In that video they say, "When someone is always in your mind without any kind of communication, that means, they are also thinking about you." This doesn't work like that I guess. I mean, Does it really make sense? At least in my case it doesn't." </p>

Its been a long time I haven't heard your voice. My heart was telling me to call you, maybe this time you will accept my apologize but last time the way you blocked me and removed your facebook page dreadfully broke my heart. I know I did the same thing with you. However, it hurts. So don't worry, I'm never ever gonna distrub you again. Take your space.</p>

              <p class="ag">A lingering question is pounding in my head for a long time, don't get me wrong. I might sound like a stupid to you but yet wanna ask you. You were the head of FDT department, right? Then why did you left that? I wonder why, I mean did you do that because of me? Maybe you had some personal issues, right? Why would you do that for me?   But you left that post when I hurted you the most. I don't know, I genuinely don't know what happend there. You guys are exceedingly complicated. But if if my intution is true then I'm also agree with that proverb....  </p>
